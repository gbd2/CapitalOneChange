<h1>Change</h1>

Change is an application that provides users with mature financial allocation advice. It was created for Hackrice 13, specially designed to "Reimagine banking" for Capital One. Change is meant to be a user-friendly interface that allows anyone, no matter how financially literate, to easily allocate money and save some extra change at a one-stop-shop. You can use Change by inputting in your age, salary, and how much money you will deposit for Change to allocate and watch as our algorithms determine the best way you can grow your money. In addition, try using our personal AI-powered chatbot that was designed to give tailored responses regarding the fund allocation strategy described! For this project, we used Python, PyQt5, NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and the ChatGPT API.

<h2> How do I use Change? </h2>

To use Change, run the **PyGui.py** file and input your salary, age, deposit, and preferred risk level. When submitted, graphical results will appear on your screen. If you have any questions about your results or do not understand what you are seeing, you can use the chatbot feature by enterring the chat and asking your question.
